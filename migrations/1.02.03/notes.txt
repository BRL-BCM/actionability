1. Go to your project settings which employ the genboree_ac plugin and decide whether to
require HTTPS (recommended) or not for API calls. If you don't, keep in mind that Redmine's API key authentication supports
HTTPBasic authentication and the credential info (account + Redmine API key for account) will be sent unencrypted. Doesn't matter
for public projects with appropriate permissions of course.

2. You must verify that BOTH the AC "curation" project *AND* the AC "release" project have the Release settings filled in.
    . Obviously for the "curation" project the settings talk about the release project and KB.
    . While for the "release" project the same values talk are present and of course talk about itself.
    . The settings may be blank in the "release" project. This is NOT ALLOWED and will cause AC API & WAG Kafka problems.
    . The release related settings to review are:
          "Release KB (full rsrcPath)" - /REST/v1/grp/actionability/kb/actionability_release
          "Release Track Base Url" - /redmine/projects/actionability_release/genboree_ac/

3. Set in AC "curation" and "release" projects the following property:
    * Doc-Released MQ Config File = /usr/local/brl/data/messages/conf/ac-release-wag.json

4. In redmine "permissions report" give permission "View Docs Status Page" for everyone
