Set values for the 4 new columns appropriately (on plugin's settings page):
     - Template Sets Collection => TemplateSets (Both Editing and Release KBs)
     - Url Mount Dir => "/redmine/projects/actionability_release/genboree_ac/" (Release KB) and "/redmine/projects/actionability/genboree_ac/" (Editing/Working KB)
     - Release Track Base Url => "/redmine/projects/actionability_release/genboree_ac/" (Editing/Working KB) and empty for the Release KB
     - Is AC Release Track ? => Checked for the release KB and keep unchecked for the editing KB.
Set appropriate permissions for the new 'Doc Versions' page in the 'Roles and Permissions' interface accessible to redmine admin. Ideally available to everyone for now ?
